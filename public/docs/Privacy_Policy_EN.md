# REHAND APP PRIVACY POLICY (EN)

## Controller/Provider (to be completed)

Privacy contact: [privacy@…] | Support: [support@…]  
Data Protection Officer (if appointed): [name / e‑mail]  
Effective date: [Month DD, YYYY]

## 1. Scope & Who We Are
This Policy explains how we process personal data in the ReHand mobile application and related services (the “App”). The App is a wellness/fitness product aimed at general activity, mobility, and wellbeing. It is not a medical device, does not provide medical advice, and is not for diagnosis or treatment.

## 2. Data We Process
### 2.1 Account data
- Email, name/alias, password (hashed), account settings.

### 2.2 Wellness/activity data
- Self‑reported fitness level, training preferences, activity logs, progress statistics, technique cues and assessments generated by algorithms.

### 2.3 Camera & sensors
- If you enable motion analysis, image processing occurs locally on your device in real time; we do not store raw video/photos or transmit them to our servers. We may store analysis results (motion metrics) to display statistics.

### 2.4 Technical data
- Device/app identifiers, OS version, diagnostics (crash logs), anonymized usage analytics (if enabled).

### 2.5 Contact/communications
- Support tickets, survey/feedback responses.

### 2.6 Third‑party sources (optional)
- Only if you connect external accounts/services (e.g., Apple/Google sign‑in). We do not integrate medical sources (e.g., HealthKit/Google Fit) unless you explicitly enable a dedicated integration with separate consent.

> Note: We do not collect precise geolocation, biometrics, or medical data beyond the “wellness/activity” scope described. If we add such features in the future, we will request separate consent.

## 3. Purposes & Legal Bases (GDPR)
1. Provide the App (account, features, security) – Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract).
2. Wellness/activity data (personalization, stats, cues) – your explicit consent to process information relating to health/wellness in a general sense – Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR. You can withdraw consent in settings (this may disable certain features).
3. Analytics/improvements, fraud prevention – Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests – quality and safety). You may object.
4. Communications (support, service notices) – Art. 6(1)(b/c/f) GDPR.
5. Direct marketing (optional) – email/push only with your consent; you can opt out anytime.

## 4. Retention
We keep data for as long as your account is active. After deletion, we erase or anonymize data within [30/60] days, except for backups that expire per rotation cycles. Billing records (if any) are kept per legal requirements. Diagnostics logs are typically kept for up to 180 days.

## 5. Sharing & Processors
We do not sell your data. We share it only with:

- Processors acting on our behalf (hosting/cloud, analytics, support) under data processing agreements;
- Public authorities where required by law;
- Recipients you choose (e.g., a coach/therapist via a “share progress” feature). You can revoke access at any time.

Key vendors (to be completed): [cloud provider, region], [analytics tools].

## 6. International Transfers
Where data is transferred outside the EEA/UK (e.g., to the U.S.), we implement appropriate safeguards, notably Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and additional technical/organizational measures. We can provide details upon request.

## 7. Security
We implement safeguards appropriate to the risk: encrypted transport (TLS), encryption at rest with our providers, access controls, environment segregation, and security testing. Camera analysis runs on‑device to minimize transmitted data.

## 8. Your Rights (EU/EEA/UK)
You have the rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, port, object to processing based on legitimate interests, and withdraw consent (without affecting past processing). You can lodge a complaint with your data protection authority. Use the App tools or contact us at [privacy@…].

## 9. Children
The App is intended for adults; users 13+ may use it with parental consent and supervision. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## 10. HIPAA & U.S. Notices
In the consumer context, we are not a HIPAA covered entity or business associate. Do not submit PHI unless a separate agreement is in place. We follow high privacy and security standards. For U.S. users, in case of a breach involving health information, we will comply with applicable laws, including the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule.

## 11. U.S. State Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA & others)
If you are a California resident (and similarly under other state laws), you may request information about categories of data collected, sources, purposes, and disclosures; request access, deletion, and correction; and you have the right to non‑discrimination. We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by CCPA/CPRA and do not engage in cross‑context behavioral advertising. Submit requests via [privacy@…].

## 12. Automated Decisions & AI
We use algorithms/AI to generate movement cues and statistics. This does not produce legal effects nor similarly significantly affect you. You can disable certain features in settings.

## 13. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy for legitimate reasons (law, security, new features). We will notify you of material changes in‑App and/or by email, indicating the effective date.

## 14. Contact
- Privacy inquiries/requests: [privacy@…]
- Security incident reports: [security@…]
- Postal address: [company address]

## Optional addenda (remove if not applicable)
- HealthKit/Google Fit integrations: if enabled in the future, data from these sources will be used solely for wellness features in the App, not for advertising/marketing, and will not be shared with third parties without your explicit consent; we comply with Apple/Google guidelines.
- Processing on behalf of organizations (B2B/HIPAA): requires a separate agreement (DPA/BAA).
- Processing locations: if we use data centers in [EU/US], specify regions and cloud providers.
